            My goal was designing a mobile application that had something to do with smart homes generally. 

            After contemplating a few ideas, I chose an app that would let pet owners control their smart bowl for automated feedings, analysing pet feeding behaviour, etc.

            I also used the “Smart Napf” to get more familiar with designing and prototyping using Figma.
