            TipTalk.me is a platform specifically designed for growing onesâ€™ social media community by getting to know your followers and sharing knowledge about yourself.

            Future plans for TipTalk.me include adding a payment gateway for allowing fans to tip social media creators for receiving an answer more briefly.

            Creators will then be able to cashout all their earnings from within their profile panel.
